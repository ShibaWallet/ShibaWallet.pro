                        <p class="text-gray-700">Welcome! ShibaWallet Labs (“we,” “our,” or “us”)
                            provides its services through its website located at shibawallet.pro and related mobile
                            applications and products (collectively the “Services” or “ShibaWallet”).
                            Before using our Services, please read the Terms of Service (the “Terms” or the “Agreement”)
                            carefully, along with any other policies or notices on ShibaWallet’s website or mobile
                            applications, and our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy).
                            Together, these materials contain terms, rules, and guidelines related to your use of ShibaWallet.

                        <p class="text-gray-700">We know that Terms can be long and confusing, so we will do our best to
                            keep things as clear and concise as possible. This section provides a brief summary of the
                            highlights of this Agreement. Please note that when you accept this Agreement,
                            you are accepting all of the terms and conditions and not just this section.
                            ShibaWallet provides self-hosted wallet services for Ethereum-based blockchains.
                            By creating or importing a wallet, downloading or running our mobile application, or
                            visiting our website, you are agreeing to our Terms, so please read carefully.
                            These terms outline approved uses of ShibaWallet, various licenses that we grant to you,
                            and licenses that you grant us.
                            If you have any questions or comments related to this Agreement, please send us a message on
                            our website at support@shibawallet.pro or contact us through Twitter, or Telegram.
                            If you do not agree to this Agreement or any modifications to this Agreement, you should not
                            use our Services.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="font-weight-bold">HOW YOU ACCEPT THIS POLICY</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700">By creating or importing a locally hosted wallet (a “Wallet”), or
                            visiting our website, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to these
                            Terms, as well as the accompanying [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy)
                            We reserve the right to change these Terms at any time. Any such changes with respect to
                            your use of ShibaWallet will take effect immediately when posted on our website or on our
                            mobile application. Your continued use of ShibaWallet following
                            any such change will signify your acceptance to be bound by the then current Terms. Please
                            check the effective date above to determine if there have been any changes since you have
                            last reviewed these Terms.
                            If you do not agree to this Agreement or any modifications to this Agreement, you should not
                            use ShibaWallet.
                            Failure or delay by ShibaWallet in enforcing or partially enforcing any provision of these
                            Terms shall not be construed as a waiver of any rights.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="font-weight-bold">ELIGIBILITY</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700">To be eligible to use ShibaWallet, you must be at least eighteen (18)
                            years old and be able to form legally binding contracts.
                            If you are using our Services on behalf of a legal entity, you further represent and warrant
                            that: (a) the legal entity is duly organized and validly existing under the applicable laws
                            of the jurisdiction of its organization; and (b) you are
                            duly authorized by such legal entity to act on its behalf.
                            You can only use our Services if permitted under the laws of your jurisdiction. Please make
                            sure that these Terms are in compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations that apply to
                            you.
                            By using ShibaWallet, you represent and warrant that you meet all eligibility requirements
                            that we outline in these Terms. We may still refuse to let certain people access or use
                            ShibaWallet, however, and we reserve the right to change our
                            eligibility criteria at any time.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="font-weight-bold">THE BLOCKCHAIN SERVICES</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700">ShibaWallet is software that (a) generates Wallet addresses and
                            encrypted private keys that you may use to send and receive Ethereum and related
                            cryptographically secured tokens (the “Virtual Currency”); (b) allows users to browse third
                            party
                            decentralized applications (“DApps” or “DApp”) through the mobile application’s DApp
                            browser; and (c) facilitates the submission of Virtual Currency transaction data to
                            Ethereum-based blockchains (the “Ethereum Networks”) without requiring you
                            to download or install the associated Ethereum-based software to your local device.
                            Wallet Address, Private Key, and Backup Capabilities. An encrypted backup of certain
                            information associated with the Wallet can be stored on your device in Keystore JSON format.
                            The private key is connected to the Wallet address and, together,
                            they can be used to authorize the transfer of Virtual Currency to and from that Wallet
                            address. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your private key and any
                            mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with your Wallet. You must
                            keep your Wallet address, mnemonic (backup) phrase, and private key access information
                            secure. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of Virtual Currency associated
                            with the Wallet.
                            ShibaWallet Cannot Assist With Password Retrieval. ShibaWallet stores your Wallet address
                            but does not receive or store your Wallet password, encrypted private key, unencrypted
                            private key, or mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with your
                            Wallet. We cannot, therefore, assist you with Wallet password retrieval. We cannot generate
                            a new password for your Wallet if you fail to remember your original password. If you have
                            not safely stored a backup of any Wallet address and private
                            key pairs maintained in your Wallet, you accept and acknowledge that any Virtual Currency
                            you have associated with such a Wallet address will become inaccessible if you do not have
                            your Wallet password.
                            Virtual Currency Transactions. In order to be completed, all proposed Virtual Currency
                            transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the Virtual Currency’s associated public
                            blockchain. Such networks are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks
                            supported by independent third parties, which we do not own, control, or operate. We have no
                            control over the Ethereum Networks and, therefore, cannot and do not ensure that any
                            transaction details that you submit via our Services will be
                            confirmed and processed. By using ShibaWallet, you acknowledge and agree that the
                            transaction details you submit may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the
                            Ethereum Networks.
                            ShibaWallet Does Not Store or Transmit Virtual Currency. We do not store, send, or receive
                            Virtual Currency. Any transfer that occurs in any Virtual Currency occurs on the
                            Ethereum-based blockchains and not on a network owned by us. We
                            therefore do not guarantee that ShibaWallet can affect the transfer of title or right in
                            any Virtual Currency.
                            Accuracy of Information Provided by User. You represent and warrant that any information you
                            provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You accept and acknowledge that we are
                            not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in
                            connection with any Virtual Currency transaction initiated via the Services. We strongly
                            encourage you to review your transaction details carefully before attempting to transfer a
                            Virtual Currency.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">You must either import or create a Wallet in order to use ShibaWallet.
                            When you create a Wallet, you will be assigned a private key. You will be prompted to

                            responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your private key and keystore, and will
                            be fully responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. You agree to
                            immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your
                            password, account, or any other breach of security.
                            We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this
                            paragraph. When you create a Wallet, you are strongly advised to take precautions in order
                            to avoid loss of access to and/or control over your Wallet.
                            Suggested measures include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) creating a strong
                            password that you do not use for any other website or online service; (b) using the backup
                            functionality provided by the Wallet or safeguard your private
                            key and mnemonic (backup) phrase on an external hard drive which, all users, especially
                            users who have more than $100,000 USD in assets, are encouraged to do even if they are
                            utilizing the Services’ backup functionality; (c) maintaining the
                            security of your Wallet by protecting the private key and mnemonic (backup) phrase
                            associated with your Wallet by, for example, limiting access to your computer and your
                            Wallet; and (d) promptly notifying us if you discover or otherwise suspect
                            any security breaches related to your Wallet.
                            Push Notifications. You may agree to receive push notifications from ShibaWallet that will
                            alert you when Ethereum-based blockchains are congested and when transactions involving your
                            Wallet have been completed. Push notifications can be
                            enabled to display information about Token Launches. If you would like to receive push
                            notifications, you must opt in to the service by accessing “Settings” and enabling “Push
                            Notifications”.
                            Payment and Fees. ShibaWallet does not currently charge any fees for any of its Services.
                            However, we reserve the right to do so in the future and, in such case, any applicable fees
                            will be displayed prior to you using any service to which a
                            fee applies.
                            Transactions. Once transaction details have been submitted via the Services, we cannot
                            assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction. ShibaWallet has no control over
                            any Ethereum-based blockchain and does not have the ability to
                            facilitate any cancellation or modification requests. You must ensure that you have an
                            adequate balance in your Wallet and/or gas to complete transactions before initiating a
                            transaction. You acknowledge and agree that we will not be liable for
                            any failed transactions due to insufficient funds or gas associated with your ShibaWallet
                            account.
                            Taxes. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions
                            that you have submitted transaction details for via the Services, and it is your
                            responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate
                            tax authority. You agree that we are not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to
                            your Ethereum-based transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding, or remitting any
                            taxes arising from any Virtual Currency-related
                            transactions.

                            using our Services. This includes any local, provincial, state, federal, national, or

                            participating in money laundering or by financing terrorist activities, we will take

                            to use another user’s Wallet without authorization or use our Services in any manner that
